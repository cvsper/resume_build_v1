# 🎉 TEMPLATE SYNTAX ERROR RESOLVED

## ✅ Issue Status: **COMPLETELY FIXED**

The Jinja2 template syntax error has been **successfully resolved**. Both the JavaScript structure issue and the template block structure have been fixed.

## 🔍 Error Resolution Summary

### Original Error
```
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Unexpected end of template. 
Jinja was looking for the following tags: 'endblock'. 
The innermost block that needs to be closed is 'block'.
```

### Root Cause Identified
- **Missing `{% endblock %}` tag** for the `scripts` block
- **Template block structure was unbalanced** after our JavaScript fixes
- Scripts block opened at line 1042 but never properly closed

### Solution Applied
1. **Added missing `{% endblock %}` tag** at the end of the template
2. **Verified template block balance** - now properly structured
3. **Maintained JavaScript fix integrity** - all functions still properly enclosed

## 🧪 Verification Results

### ✅ Template Structure Verification
```
Block openings: 4
  Line 9: head
  Line 65: styles  
  Line 691: content
  Line 1042: scripts

Block closings: 4
  Line 63: endblock (head)
  Line 689: endblock (styles)
  Line 1040: endblock (content)
  Line 1495: endblock (scripts)

✅ Template structure is balanced!
```

### ✅ Jinja2 Parser Test
- Template parses successfully without syntax errors
- No more "Unexpected end of template" error
- All Jinja2 blocks properly closed

### ✅ JavaScript Functions Still Working
- `upgradePlan()` function: ✅ Found and properly enclosed
- `downgradePlan()` function: ✅ Found and properly enclosed  
- `createConfirmationModal()` function: ✅ Found and properly enclosed

### ✅ Flask Application Status
- Application responding correctly on port 5006
- No template rendering errors
- Ready for subscription button testing

## 🎯 Final Template Structure

```html
{% block head %}
  <!-- head content -->
{% endblock %}

{% block styles %}  
  <!-- styles content -->
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <!-- main page content -->
{% endblock %}

{% block scripts %}
<script>
  // All JavaScript functions properly enclosed
  function upgradePlan(plan) { ... }
  function downgradePlan(plan) { ... }  
  function createConfirmationModal(...) { ... }
</script>
{% endblock %} ← This was missing and has been added
```
