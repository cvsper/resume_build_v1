# 🎉 SUBSCRIPTION BUTTONS - ISSUE RESOLVED!

## ✅ **Problem Identified and Fixed**

### **Issue #1: Authentication Required**
- **Problem**: Subscription buttons weren't showing because users weren't logged in
- **Solution**: Users must log in first at `http://127.0.0.1:5006/login`

### **Issue #2: JavaScript ReferenceError**
- **Problem**: `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: upgradePlan`
- **Root Cause**: The `upgradePlan()` function was defined outside of `<script>` tags
- **Solution**: ✅ **FIXED** - Moved all JavaScript functions inside proper `<script>` tags

## 🔧 **Technical Fix Applied**

**File**: `templates/profile.html`
**Change**: Moved the closing `</script>` tag to include all subscription functions:

```javascript
// These functions are now properly inside <script> tags:
function upgradePlan(plan) { ... }
function downgradePlan(plan) { ... }  
function createConfirmationModal(...) { ... }
</script>
```
