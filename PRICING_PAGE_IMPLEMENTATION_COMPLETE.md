# üéâ SUBSCRIPTION FLOW MODIFICATION - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## üìã Task Completed

**OBJECTIVE:** Modify the subscription button in the dashboard to redirect users to a subscription options page where they can choose from three subscription plans, instead of directly taking them to Stripe checkout.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Created Dedicated Pricing Page** 
- **File:** `/templates/pricing.html`
- **Features:**

  - Three subscription plans: Free ($0), Pro ($9.99/month), Premium ($19.99/month)
  - Dynamic plan selection based on current user subscription status
  - Complete JavaScript functionality for upgrades/downgrades
  - Responsive design with mobile optimization
  - Integration with existing Stripe checkout and billing management
  - Customer testimonials and money-back guarantee messaging

### 2. **Added Backend Route**
